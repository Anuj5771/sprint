##  What is this ?

This document defines the alerting rules, thresholds, and response process for **monitoring the health and performance of the database system**. It ensures timely detection and resolution of critical issues like high CPU usage, too many DB connections, or slow queries.


##  Why is this Important?

-  **Prevents downtime** by catching issues early (e.g., resource spikes, connection overloads).
-  **Improves reliability** of applications relying on the database.
-  **Optimizes performance** by identifying long-running queries and resource bottlenecks.
-  **Standardizes response** for on-call teams and avoids confusion during incidents.


##  Monitored Metrics

The following database and system metrics are actively monitored:

| Metric              | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CPU Usage**        | Measures CPU consumption on the database server.                           |
| **Memory Usage**     | Monitors RAM utilization.                                                  |
| **Disk Space**       | Checks free vs. used disk space.                                           |
| **DB Connections**   | Tracks the number of active connections to the database.                   |
| **Query Time**       | Observes average response time of executed SQL queries.                    |
| **Error Rate**       | Counts DB-specific errors like timeouts, failed queries, etc.              |
| **Replication Lag**  | (If applicable) Monitors delay between primary and replica DB nodes.       |

---
##  How It Works

1. Monitoring agents (like **Prometheus Node Exporter**, **CloudWatch Agent**, or **Datadog Agent**) collect metrics from the database and server.
2. These metrics are pushed or scraped into the **monitoring system** (e.g., Prometheus, CloudWatch).
3. Based on predefined **alerting rules**, the system continuously checks for threshold breaches.
4. If a threshold is crossed (e.g., CPU > 85%), an **alert** is triggered.
5. Alerts are routed via **notification channels** (e.g., Slack, Email, PagerDuty) to the on-call team.
6. The on-call engineer investigates the issue using logs, dashboards, or CLI tools and takes action.
7. Once resolved, the alert is closed, and a post-incident report may be created if needed.

##  Alert Thresholds

Alerts are triggered when thresholds are breached for a defined duration. Below are the **3 critical thresholds** currently configured:


| Metric               | Threshold                               | Severity | Action                                                                 |
|----------------------|------------------------------------------|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CPU Usage**         | > 85% for 5 consecutive minutes          | High     | Investigate top queries/processes. Scale if required.                 |
| **DB Connections**    | > 90% of `max_connections` for 3 minutes | High     | Check app behavior, release idle connections, or increase pool limit. |
| **Query Response Time** | > 500ms average over 5 minutes           | Medium   | Analyze slow queries, optimize indexes, check for locks/contention.   |


>  *All alerts can be configured in Prometheus, Datadog, New Relic, or AWS CloudWatch depending on stack.*

## üîÅ Alerting Process

| Step        | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **1. Detection**   | Monitoring tool detects a threshold breach and generates an alert.        |
| **2. Notification**| Alert is sent to Slack, Email, or PagerDuty with relevant details.       |
| **3. Triage**      | On-call engineer investigates using logs, dashboards, or DB CLI tools.   |
| **4. Resolution**  | Issue is mitigated (e.g., restart, kill query, scale). Metrics normalized. |


##  Best Practices

- Always correlate alerts with logs for better context.
- Add **cooldown periods** to avoid alert flapping.
- Schedule **maintenance windows** to silence non-critical alerts.
- Monitor slow query logs and long-running transactions regularly.

##  Tools Used

- Prometheus + Grafana
- AWS CloudWatch
- Datadog (optional)
- Slack / Email for alert routing

##  DB Alerting: Best Practices

| Best Practice                | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Set Realistic Thresholds    | Avoid false alerts; use 5-min avg where possible.                          |
| Categorize Severity         | Tag alerts as High / Medium / Low.                                         |
| Add Context to Alerts       | Include metric, DB name, time, and hint.                                   |
| Avoid Alert Storms          | Use deduplication or grouping.                                             |
| Use Maintenance Windows     | Silence alerts during known downtimes.                                     |
| Auto-Resolve Alerts         | Close alerts when metrics normalize.                                       |
| Link Dashboards/Runbooks    | Help on-call team act faster.                                              |
| Regularly Tune Rules        | Review alert logic after infra/app changes.                                |
